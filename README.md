# RGB-to-Component-Transcoder
A DIY RGB to Component Video Transcoder Schematic to make your own video conversion boxes. 

A simple DIY schematic for creating your own RGB video to Component / YUV video.

This schematic does not do any upscaling and was designed to support old CRT TVs that only have component video inputs (not RGB scart like in many european countries) and primarily as way to open up more output options for retro consoles using an external method (rather needing to directly modify the internal hardware).
